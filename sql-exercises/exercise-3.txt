Exercise

    Write a query to select the body masses from penguins that are less
    than 3000.0 grams.

    select
            body_mass_g
    from penguins
    where body_mass_g < 3000


    Write another query to select the species and sex of penguins that
    weight less than 3000.0 grams. This shows that the columns displayed
    and those used in filtering are independent of each other.

    select
            species,
            sex
    from penguins
    where body_mass_g < 3000;
