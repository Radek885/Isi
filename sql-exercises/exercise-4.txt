Exercise

    Use the not operator to select penguins that are not Gentoos.

    select
        species
    from penguins
    where species != 'Gentoos';

    SQL's or is an inclusive or: it succeeds if either or both conditions
    are true. SQL does not provide a specific operator for exclusive
    or, which is true if either but not both conditions are true, but the
    same effect can be achieved using and, or, and not. Write a query to
    select penguins that are female or on Torgersen Island but not both.

    select
        species,
        sex,
        island
    from penguins
    where (sex = 'FEMALE' and island != 'Torgersen') or (sex != 'FEMALE' and island = 'Torgersen');
