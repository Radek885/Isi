Exercise

1.    Write a SQL query to select the islands and species from rows 50 to 60
    inclusive of the penguins table. Your result should have 11 rows.

    select
            island,
            species
    from penguins
    order by island, species
    limit 10 offset 50;


    Modify your query to select distinct combinations of island and species
    from the same rows and compare the result to what you got in part 1.

    select distinct
            island,
            species
    from penguins
    order by island, species;
