Saving and restoring data as text:

    1. Re-create the notes table in an in-memory database and then use
    SQLite's .output and .dump commands to save the database to a
    file called notes.sql. Inspect the contents of this file: how
    has your data been stored?

    2. Start a fresh SQLite session and load notes.sql using the .read
    command. Inspect the database using .schema and select *: is
    everything as you expected?

    .output notes.sql
    .dump
    .read notes.sql

Saving and restoring data in binary format:

    1. Re-create the notes table in an in-memory database once again
    and use SQLite's .backup command to save it to a file
    called notes.db. Inspect this file using od -c notes.db or a text
    editor that can handle binary data: how has your data been stored?

    2. Start a fresh SQLite session and load notes.db using the .restore
    command. Inspect the database using .schema and select *: is
    everything as you expected?

    .backup notes.db
