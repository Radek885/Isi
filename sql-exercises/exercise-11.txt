Exercise

Write a query that uses filter to calculate the average body masses of heavy
penguins (those over 4500 grams) and light penguins (those under 3500 grams)
simultaneously. Is it possible to do this using where instead of filter?

select
    avg(body_mass_g) filter (where body_mass_g > 4500) as avg_heavy,
    avg(body_mass_g) filter (where body_mass_g < 3500) as avg_light
from penguins;

przy pomocy podzapytań można osiągnąć identyczny efekt bez użycia filter

select
    (select avg(body_mass_g) from penguins where body_mass_g > 4500) as avg_heavy,
    (select avg(body_mass_g) from penguins where body_mass_g < 3500) as avg_light;
