Find the least time each person spent on any job. Your output should
show that mik and po each spent 0.5 hours on some job. Can you
find a way to show the name of the job as well using the SQL you have
seen so far?

select work.person, MIN(job.billable), job.name
from work join job on work.job = job.name
group by work.person
