Using an in-memory database, define a table called notes with two text
columns author and note and then add three or four rows. Use a query
to check that the notes have been stored and that you can (for example)
select by author name.

What happens if you try to insert too many or too few values into notes?
What happens if you insert a number instead of a string into the note
field?
